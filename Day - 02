# 📅 Day 02 – ArrayList in Java

## 🎯 Objective
To understand **ArrayList** in Java and learn how to store, access, and manipulate dynamic data efficiently.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to ArrayList
- Creating an ArrayList
- Adding elements
- Accessing elements using index
- Updating elements
- Removing elements
- Iterating through ArrayList
- Size and dynamic nature of ArrayList

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- ArrayList is a **resizable (dynamic) array**
- It is part of the **Java Collections Framework**
- Allows duplicate elements
- Maintains insertion order
- Provides built-in methods for easy operations

---

## ⚙️ Common Methods Used
- `add()`
- `get()`
- `set()`
- `remove()`
- `size()`
- `contains()`

---

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings
- Unlike arrays, ArrayList size can grow or shrink dynamically
- Indexing starts from **0**
- Internally uses an array to store elements
- Better suited when frequent insertions/removals are required

---

## 📌 Best Practices
- Use generics (`ArrayList<Integer>`) to ensure type safety
- Prefer ArrayList over arrays when size is unknown
- Avoid unnecessary conversions between array and ArrayList

---

## ✅ Status
Completed
